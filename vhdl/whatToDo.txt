This passages are valid for normal version and optimized version. BE CAREFUL that we work with 2 top entity: filter (base and base_inputshifted version) and filter_opt (all the opt versions) which have to be updated in several scripts. This means that, if, for example, you perform all the passages for unfolding and then for unfolding_v1, all the generated files like verilog, vcd ecc.. are overwritten from the unfolding_v1. Don't mix passages with different versions or you will obtain inconsistent files.

Simulation:
	0. check that the correct top entity with correct shift is in src folder (leave name filter_opt for all the optimized versions).
	1. check that the parameters of the filter are correctly set in the C model
	2. execute simulation_fir_script.sh or simulation_firopt.sh to simulate and check the results of the 2 versions.
Synthesis: 
	0.check that in src there is the the correct version of the filter/filter_opt with the correct shift input.
	1.in Report: you must have the folder of the filter version whith inside the folder clock_x_xx where x_xx is the clock.
	2.in syn: open synth.tcl and modify the variable to choose between filter and filter opt, the clock and the corresponding folder for the report.
	Be careful at the last line which perform the verilog generation (somethimes it is commented). 
	In verilog_gen.tcl modify the variable with filter or filter_opt (filter_opt is used also for the further version with pipe).
	./source_script.sh init design vision and open it, then source synth.tcl. Report and netlist are saved in corresponding folders.
Backannotation (do it on FM/4 syn!!!): 
	Set the clock period in /tb/clk_gen.vhd equal to the one used in synopsys
	Go in sim and ./sim_SW.sh  or sim_SW_firopt.sh
	then go in syn, modify and execute ./vcd2saif.sh
	finally open design vision and source power_estimation.tcl (edit before with folder name and top_entity)
Innovus:
	inside folder Innovus create a folder for your version (base, base_inputshifted, firopt, firopt_inputshifte).
	Copy-paste in each folder the files design_global, mmmm_design_tcl, innovus.cmd, pow_consum.cmd, script.sh
	./script.sh eliminates all the other files and open innovus
	then source design.globals and source innovus.cmd
	check in folder timingReports that the .slk files contain all positive slacks

	move in sim, modify the parameters in postP&Rsim.do and ./sim_post_p&r.sh (or firopt version) to create the filter_innovus.vcd file (or filter_opt_innovus.vcd)

	Finally come back to innovus, reopen it if necessary and source pow_consum.cmd (if not present copy paste from shifted_based and check the 		first row the correct path for the .enc [I don't known how to set variale in .cmd]).
	Lots of folder/files are generated, what we need are the starting file, the power.txt, the filter_main.htm in summaryReport.
