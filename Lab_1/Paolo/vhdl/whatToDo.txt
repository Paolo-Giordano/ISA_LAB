This passages should be valid for normal version and optimized version(normal ok, opt still to try). 
BE CAREFUL that we work with 2 top entity: filter (based and based_shifted version) and filter_opt (all the opt version) whihch have to be update in several script. This means that as example if you do all the passages for unfolding and then for unfolding_v1, all the file generate like verilog, vcd ecc.. will be overwritted from the unfolding_v2. Don't mix passages with different version or you will obtain inconsistent file.

Simulation:
	0. check that the correct top entity with correct shift is in src folder (leave name filter_opt for all the ufolding version).
	1. simulate simulation_script.sh or simulation_firopt.sh to simulate and check the results of the 2 version.
Synthesis: 
	0.check that in src there is the the correct version of the filter/filter_opt with the correct shift input.
	1.in Report: you must have the folder of the filter version whith inside the folder clock_x_xx where x_xx is the clock.
	2.in syn: open synth.tcl and modify the variable to choose between filter and filter opt, the clock and the corresponding folder for the report.
			Be careful at the last line which perform the verilog generation (somethimes it is commented). In verilog_gen.tcl modify the variable for 				filter or filter_opt (filter_opt is used also for the further version with pipe).
			./source_script.sh init design vision and open it, then source synth.tcl. Report and netlist are saved in corresponding folders.
Backannotation (do it on FM/4 syn!!!): 
	Go in sim and ./sim_SW.sh     NOTE: just for base version (other file for filteropt?)
	then go in syn and ./vcd2saif.sh, finally open design vision and source power_estimation.tcl (edit before with folder name and top_entity)
Innovus:
	inside folder Innovus create a folder for your version (based, based_shifted, firopt, firopt_shifted).
	Copy-paste from based_shifted design_global, mmmm_design_tcl, innovus.cmd, pow_consum.cmd, script.sh
	./script.sh eliminate all the other file and open innovus, then source design_global and source innovus.cmd (could eliminate also pow_consum.cmd, 		be careful cause somethimes doesn't work properly)

	move in sim and ./sim_post_p&r.sh to create the filter_innovus.vcd file (or filter_opt_innovus.vcd)

	Finally come back in innovus, reopen it if necessary and source power_consum.cmd (if not present copy paste from shifted_based and check the 		first row the correct path for the .enc [I don't known how to set variale in .cmd]).
	Lots of folder/files are generated, what we need are the starting file, the power.txt, the filter_main.htm in summaryReport. In thiming report 		check for violation on hold time and then it doesn't need anymore.
