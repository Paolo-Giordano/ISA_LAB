Outside the folders there are all the different version of filter. v1, v2, v3 are piped version. Don't move them.
Version v3 is only for shifted version that required 1 additional pipe stage.
In source there is filter.vhd and filter_opt.vhd. keep the name to work with the script. If you want to use other version, just copy-pase in src and change name (eliminate the previous before).
